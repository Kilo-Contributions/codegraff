# 0246. Jev picks each turn's effort, alongside the first request

Status: accepted 2026-10-03

## Context

Logged in to Codegraff, graff offers GPT-6 and MiMo v2.6 models the
`jev_effort` tool, which asks the hosted Jev selector to choose the
reasoning effort. In eval runs the models never called it: across 132 graff
runs on two models the tool was offered every time and called none. The
ChatGPT-plan sign-in, `chatgpt-new` (ADR 0229), was also not eligible, so
most ChatGPT-plan users were never offered Jev at all.

Asking Jev before a turn's first request worked but cost a call's wait,
about a third of a second in the median, on every turn.

## Decision

- `chatgpt-new` GPT-6 models are eligible for Jev, like `codex` and `openai`.
- When a root turn starts on an eligible model at the session's default
  effort, graff asks Jev itself, concurrently with the turn's first model
  request. The pick applies from the turn's next request, where pending
  selections are already applied, so it adds no wait.
- The pick holds for that turn and is never saved. An effort the user chose
  is never overridden, an effort changed during the turn is kept, and a pick
  still in flight when the turn ends is canceled and dropped. A canceled pick
  does not open Jev's session circuit; a failed one does, as before.
- Jev sees a summary built locally from the request: its words, with code,
  paths, file names, URLs, emails, identifiers and number-heavy or long
  tokens dropped, at most 280 bytes. `GRAFF_JEV_AUTO=0` turns the per-turn
  pick off; the tool is unchanged.

## Consequences

Every eligible turn makes one gateway call; its charge is negligible. A
turn's first request always runs at the default effort, so a one-request
turn gets no benefit. On the eval tasks Jev picked the default effort every
time, so time and pass rates were unchanged. Revisit if Jev's picks start to
cost time or accuracy, or if starting the turn at the previous turn's pick
proves worth it.
